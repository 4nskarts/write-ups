# Welcome to my CTF Writeups Hub! 🎉

Hey there, friend! Welcome to my cozy corner where I dish out all the deets on how to crush those Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

## What's Cookin'?

I've cooked up a feast of writeups for you, covering a smorgasbord of CTF challenge types. Here's what's on the menu:

- 🌐 Web Exploitation: Hack your way through web apps and servers.
- 🕵️‍♀️ Forensics: Investigate digital evidence and uncover hidden gems.
- 🖼 Steganography: Find hidden messages lurking in plain sight.
- 🎲 Miscellaneous: Anything and everything in between!

Each writeup has tips, tricks, and step-by-step solutions to help you level up your hacking game. No fluff, just straight-up knowledge to help you dominate those challenges like a boss.

## Ready to Dive In?

Getting started is a breeze:

1. **Clone the repository**: Fire up your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4nskarts/write-ups.git

Please note that when I write `author: 4nskarts`, it only means I was the one who wrote the writeup, not the actual challenge.
