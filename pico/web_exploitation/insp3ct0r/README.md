## Let's Dive In

We're presented with the following page which doesn't do much.

Right off the bat, checking the source code by pressing `ctrl+u` will reveal the first part of the flag

Moreover, we see two links to a custom CSS and JS files called `mycss.css` and `myjs.js` consecutively.

Let's check what's inside `mycss.css`. Oh! the second part

Let's do the same with `myjs.js`, and bam! The third part

The main learning points for me were getting to know the `link` tag in HTML which links between the current document and an external resource *(in this case a style-sheet)*, as well as the `script` tag which is used to embed JavaScript code inside the current document. This allows the JS code to be available for use inside the HTML document as shown in the source code.
