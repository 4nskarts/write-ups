quick hint: play around with the http methods
```

## Description
```markdown
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/ 
``` 

## Solution 
As you can see from the URL we've been given, we can select two options that will change the background option with their respective color. My first instinct was to check the source code (you can press ctrl+u to view it).

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Red</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="[//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css](view-source:http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css)">
	<style>body {background-color: red;}</style>
</head>
	<body>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="panel panel-primary" style="margin-top:50px">
						<div class="panel-heading">
							<h3 class="panel-title" style="color:red">Red</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">
							<form action="[index.php](view-source:http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/index.php)" method="GET">
								<input type="submit" value="Choose Red"/>
							</form>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="panel panel-primary" style="margin-top:50px">
						<div class="panel-heading">
							<h3 class="panel-title" style="color:blue">Blue</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">
							<form action="[index.php](view-source:http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/index.php)" method="POST">
								<input type="submit" value="Choose Blue"/>
							</form>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```
We're making 2 HTTP requests to http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/index.php endpoint, both seem to change the background-color CSS property, however, we can see that the HTTP method used in each form is different "POST and GET".

If we take a glance at the challenge name `GET aHEAD`, we can try and change the HTTP method used in the request to the HEAD method. 

#### Note (from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/http/methods/head)):

The **HTTP `HEAD` method** requests the [headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) that would be returned if the `HEAD` request's URL was instead requested with the HTTP [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) method. For example, if a URL might produce a large download, a `HEAD` request could read its [`Content-Length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length) header to check the filesize without actually downloading the file.


Doing this using the **curl command** (We can also use the requests module in python or even Burpsuite).
```bash
curl -X HEAD "http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/index.php" --head
```
we get:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_8f878508}
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

And there we go, the flag is `picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_8f878508}`
